#All follow the syntax of the first example
-eq = equal to [ "$a" -eq "$b" ]
-ne = not equal

#Definitions to these can still be used. However syntax is different for the symbols**
-gt = >
-ge = >=
-lt = <
-le = <=
**EG. (( "$a" < "$b" ))

= - is equal

!= - is not equal
< - less than in ASCII alphabetical order ** if [[ "$a" < "$b" ]]
> - greater than in ASCII alphabetical order ** if [[ "$a" > "$b" ]]
